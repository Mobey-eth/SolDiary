> This is a diary of smart contracts I wrote at various times that were either for learning purposes, were too brief and/or individual to fit in a solo repository.

## **Note** :
* The code is in no particular order
* These code aren't and should not be treated as production code

Feel free to reachout to my [E-mail](mailto:Chantler.aob@gmail.com "Mobey's Email address") for any questions or inquiries.

**Code and contracts in this repository will be updated and/or maintained, _you're welcome to contribute_**
